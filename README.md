Boo website mynt project
====================

This repository contains the [Mynt](http://mynt.uhnomoli.com/) project which generates the static pages for the [Boo language website](http://boo-language.github.io/). 

That website is a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) repository which you can find [here](https://github.com/boo-language/boo-language.github.io).

##Getting set up:

This project uses Mynt, which is a static site generator similar to Jekyll, but written in Python. It's very straightforward to use one you have mynt installed and have read through the minimalist turorial.

Check out the [Mynt website](http://mynt.uhnomoli.com/) or it's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Anomareh/mynt).
